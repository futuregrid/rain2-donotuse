# FutureGrid Servers Configuration
#
# This configuration file is organized for services. So you only need to 
# configure the sections of the services that you need to use
#
#******************************************************************************

#******************************************************************************
# Portal authentication configuration
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  host:
# 
#  user:
#
#  password:
#
#  db:
#******************************************************************************

[PortalDB]
host=portal.futuregrid.org
user=USER
passwd=PASSWORD
db=DB


#******************************************************************************
# LDAP authentication configuration
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  This define the LDAP information needed by the auth module
#
#  LDAPHOST: ldap server
#
#  LDAPUSER: dn that identified the user that will connect with ldap
#
#  LDAPPASS: password of the previous user for access to ldap server
#
#  log: file where logs are stored. You should include
#  the full path, otherwise it will use the current directory or $HOME.
#******************************************************************************
[LDAP]
LDAPHOST=im3r.idp.iu.futuregrid.org
#ldap.futuregrid.org
LDAPUSER=uid=USER,ou=People,dc=futuregrid,dc=org
LDAPPASS=PASS
log=fg-auth.log

#******************************************************************************
# Image Repository Server configuration
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  port: is the port where this server (IRServer.py) will be listening
#
#  proc_max: number of request that can be processed at the same time
#
#  refresh: interval to check the status of the running requests when proc_max
#  is reached. If some request has the completed status, and a new request can 
#  be processed.
#
#  authorizedusers: list of users (separated by commas) that can use the repo 
#  using the name of other user as first argument. This is useful for other FG
#  tools that need to call the repository in behalf of an user. This also 
#  prevents that other users can hack the client to use the repository as if 
#  they were other users.
#
#  backend: Specify the desired storage backend. Possible values are: mongodb
#  mysql, swiftmysql, swiftmongo, cumulusmysql, cumulusmongo. You need to have
#  the selected backend section configured below
#
#  idp: identify providers. It can be ldappass or ldappassmd5 to authenticate
#  against LDAP (the password is sent in plain text and encrypted to the
#  auth module, respectively). It can also be drupalplain to authenticate 
#  using the drupal database
#
#  log: file where logs are stored. You should include
#  the full path, otherwise it will use the current directory or $HOME. 
#
#  log_level: debug level. It can be debug, error, info, warning  
#
#  ca_cert: authority that sign the certificate
#
#  certfile: x509 certificate used by the service
#
#  keyfile: key of the certificate
#
#  restConfFile: Configuration file for the Rest Interface. This is only needed
#  if you want to use the rest interface

#  This sections collect the different backend configurations. You only need to

#  address: Address where MongoDB or mysql are listening. In the case of mongodb
#  we can use a list of address:ports separated by commas
#

#
#  configfileS = config file that contains the password for complementary
#  service (cumulus, swift)
#
#  imgStore: Directory where the images are uploaded to the server. This is
#  a temporal directory in all cases but the mysql one. When this is a temporal
#  directory the permission must be 777 without the t bit, because the user
#  that is running the server must be able to remove the images once uploaded

#
#  wait_max: maximum time that an image has to boot, that is change from penn
#  status to runn
#
#  vmfile_*: Is the OpenNebula template to boot the proper VM where the image
#  will be generated. Currently four VM are considered. In the case of CentOS
#  we have a list of version:file separated by commas because centos 5 is not

#  parameter
#
#  addrnfs: address of the machine that shares the directory tempserver
# 
#  tempdirserver: name of the shared dir in the server. This directory will be
#  used as scratch partition for the VM. In this way, the VM disks can be small.
#  !!Users must be able to read in this directory to retrieve their images when
#  needed!!
#
#  tempdir: name of the shared dir in the VM. This is where the previous dir is
#  mounted in the VM.
#
#  http_server: Address of the http server that keeps config files 
#  for the images. This information is for IMGenerateScript.py
#
#  bcfg2_url: Address of the machine where our IMBcfg2GroupManagerServer.py

#
#  oneuser: user that will manage the VM for the image generation
#
#  onepass: password of the user. you get that executing "oneuser list" with 
#  the oneadmin user
#
#  log: file where logs are stored. You should include
#  the full path, otherwise it will use the current directory. 
#
#  log_level: debug level. It can be debug, error, info, warning
