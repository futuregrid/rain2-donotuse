INSTALLATION
============

This REST installation requires cherrypy, openssl, and the mongo
distribution. To insure these dependencies are installed just type
./install.  The install script will call the getDistribution.py
script. This script is responsible for retrieving (via wget) the
correct distribution for your computer if the destribution has not
already been installed on your computer. The getDistributions.py
script will also check to insure that the pymongo, and cherrypy are
instaled as python imports.


The install script will continue to generate the library and install
it in the appropriate /usr/local paths. /usr/local/ssl for opensl and
/usr/local/mongodb for the mongo database library.  If the account
that executes install does not have the authority to install ssl and
mongodb in those directories the generated libraries be put in the
current directory path of the REST repository: ./ssl and ./mongodb
