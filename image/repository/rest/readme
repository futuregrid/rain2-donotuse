REST

The REST interface implements the IRService API for a admin and a non admin users from unique URLs.
The admin application name within the URL would be specified as adminRest, while the non admin
application name within the URL would be specified as userRest.
For example going to the URL https://<address>:<port>/adminRest/list  would allow an admin 
user to list all the users.   



INVENTORY :

The Rest repository contains the following
Config files:  
httpConfig.conf     (specificiations for  the http server)  
httpsConfig.conf    (specifications for the https server)
adminConfig.conf    (admin user name specification)
userConfig.con      (general user name specification)

Test Files:  (twill required)
userTest.py
adminTest.py

Executables:
install
getDistribution.py

startMongo

startRestUser.py
startRestAdmin.py


FIRST TIME STARTUP
For first time execution you should run the scripts in the following order:
install     ( to insture cherrypy, openssl, and mongodb are installed)
startMongo <port #>
python startRest<"User.py"|"Admin.py">   (startRestUser.py for the user script,  startRestAdmin.py for admin script)


INSTALLATION
REST comes with dependencies: cherrypy, openssl, and mongodb and twill for testing with 
using a browser. To ensure these
dependencies are loaded on your system type: install.  Check out 
the readme-install for more specifics.


 
STARTING UP MONGODB
MONGODB is the database server. In order to start up the server, type 
startMongo < port #>  i.e startMongo 23000.  The mongod server will 
start up on port 23000. The shell prompts you to hit enter again 
only if you want to cleanly exit the mongod server.

STARTING UP REST SERVICE - Admin Users
Type -  python startRestAdmin.py , this script will start

STARTING UP REST SERVER - Non Admin Users
Type - python startRestUser.py 


Test scripts
The Rest service comes with two test scripts userTest.py and adminTest.py. 
These scripts use twill to automatically generate the rest server without
using a browser. For executing the user script type:  python userTest.py
and for admin type :  python adminTest.py.  There currently is not
an installation procedure for checking if twill is installed and wether 
or not to download twill if not the case.





Open SSL:

The install command will check if open ssl is installed and 
will generate the public, private keys and certificate if 
not already detected in the repository. T



The OpenSSL commands to generate the keys are the following:

To generate the server server.key with passphrase:
openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 2048

Remove pssphrase from the key :
openssl rsa -in server.key -out server.key

Generate the certificate:
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr

To sign by private key:
openssl x509 -req -days 60 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt
